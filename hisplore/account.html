			<h2>About HISPLORE</h2>

				<h3>What is HISPLORE? </h3>
				<p>HISPLORE is an interactive timemap where our users can look through documents from trove (www.trove.nla.au). We know what you study at school so we designed preset searches based on what you need for your studies including Australian Novels and Australian Politics. </p>

				<h3>How do we use it?</h3>
				<p> Hisplore is to be used for your studies. Simply click on one of the preset buttons on the right hand side of the map and you will be able to see a countless amount of search items based on that topic. </p>

				<p>Click on a pin either on the timeline or on the map and the document preview should come up. You can decide whether you want to read it or save it for later. Scroll down to the account section and you will be able to know how to delete these saved items!</p>

			<h2>Options </h2>
